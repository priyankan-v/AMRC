Developing an Autonomous Mobile Robot Controller

Task of this project is to develop a generalized controller for autunomous mobile robots. 
Main target of the this project is enhance autonomous robots in industries.

In here we are using SLAM toolbox on ROS2 for mapping the environment and navigate through in that environment for a given destination. This will be implemented with use of LiDAR.
Initially we have done the simulation parts in Gazebo, RViz.
